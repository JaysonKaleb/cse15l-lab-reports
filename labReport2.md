    * I called the method handleRequest.
    * This method takes a `URI` as the argument. A relevant field within the class is the String list `lines`.
    * This method was supposed to add to lines the String `toAdd`.

    * This is the result of the previous screenshot, wherein I called handleRequest by providing a `URI`.
    * This method uses a `URI` to create a chatlog. A relevant field within the method is `toAdd` which formats the URI String.
    * This method failed to add `Isaac: Hello`.
