* One thing I found cool from lab was making the grading script from lab 6. Writing code in the `grade.sh` was fun, as it was a new language and wasn't java. Seeing how the script graded each student submission gave me insight into how gradescope's autograder might work, although the script we made had a lot missing as compared to gradescope. Furthermore, being able to work in pairs for this lab was nice because the collaboration benefited my understanding of the material.
