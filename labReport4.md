* Explanation: The `bash test.sh` command was 1 up in my history. This is because I ran the command right before. By pressing the arrow key up 1 times and enter, I ran test.sh which compiled and ran the Junit tests, showing that testMerge2 failed.

* Explanation: First, `vim ListExamples.java` was ran. Then, using the backwards search command `?index1`, and next occurence `n` five times, the cursor highlighted the correct `index1`. Then, using `e` I jumped to the end of the word, then replaced 1 with 2 by using `r2`. Finally I saved my changes with `:wq`.

* Explanation: The `bash test.sh` command was 1 up in my history as I used it just before `vim ListExamples.java`. By pressing the arrow key up 1 times and enter, I ran test.sh which compiled and ran the Junit tests, showing that both tests now passed.
